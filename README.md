# README

### Brief
This repository will contain a toy envfile parser and loader someday. Note that all property values are treated as their raw string literals.

### Notes
 1. Now uses a status check for each PR to `main` with a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Setup
 - Ensure that CMake 3.28+ is installed.
 - Ensure that a C++20 supporting compiler, clangd, and a code editor supporting Git is installed.
 - Clone the repository.
 - For sanity checking, permit the two utility `.sh` scripts and run `./utility.sh help` to see all options. These are meant to build and test the project.
